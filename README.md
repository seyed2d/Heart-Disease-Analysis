# Heart-Disease-Analysis
This project predicts heart disease using machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors. It includes data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, and model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. Visualizations include the ROC curve for performance insights.
